### The Problem: A Mismatch in the Filename

File paths are very specific and must match the actual filename exactly.

  * Your actual files (seen on the left side of your screenshot) are named Screenshot_1.png and Screenshot_2.png (using an underscore).
  * Your Markdown code is trying to link to files with a space in the name (Screenshot _1.png), which don't exist.

Additionally, some of your other links and formatting could be improved for better presentation.

### The Solution

Here is the corrected and fully formatted version of your README.md file. Simply copy all the code below and paste it into your README file on GitHub.

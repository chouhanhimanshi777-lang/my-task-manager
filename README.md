# my-task-manager
This is a dynamic and responsive task manager. It lets you add new tasks with deadlines and priorities (low, medium, high), and it automatically sorts them. You can easily edit, mark as complete, or delete tasks. The app uses local storage to save your data, so your to-do list is always there when you come back.
